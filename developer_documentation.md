### cache_vectorizer.py
#### Overview
**File: cache_vectorizer.py**

#### Overview
The `cache_vectorizer.py` file defines an asynchronous text vectorizer using Redis VL and OllamaEmbeddings, with both synchronous and asynchronous embedding methods for single texts and batches of texts. This allows for efficient text representation and caching in a Redis-based system.

#### Details
#### Details
1. **Imports**
    - `OllamaEmbeddings` from `langchain_ollama`: For generating embeddings using the Ollama model.
    - `CustomTextVectorizer` from `redisvl.utils.vectorize`: A base class for creating text vectorizers with custom embedding methods.
    - `asyncio` and `List` from Python's standard library: For handling asynchronous operations and working with lists, respectively.

2. **create_vectorizer Function**
    - Initializes an instance of OllamaEmbeddings using the 'nomic-embed-text' model.
    - Defines synchronous embedding functions (`sync_embed`) for single texts and batches of texts (`sync_embed_many`). These methods use the `OllamaEmbeddings` instance to generate embeddings.
    - Defines asynchronous wrappers (`async_embed` and `async_embed_many`) for single-text and batch embedding, respectively. These wrappers utilize `asyncio.to_thread()` to run the synchronous methods in separate threads, allowing for asynchronous execution.

3. **CustomTextVectorizer Configuration**
    - The function returns a configured instance of CustomTextVectorizer, specifying the synchronous and asynchronous embedding functions as arguments.

4. **Singleton Instance Creation**
    - A singleton instance `vectorizer` is created by calling `create_vectorizer()`, allowing for easy access to the vectorizer within the application. This ensures that a single, shared instance of the vectorizer is used throughout the application, optimizing resource usage and cache coherence.

This vectorizer design enables efficient text representation in Redis VL while providing both synchronous and asynchronous capabilities to suit various use cases and optimize performance based on requirements.



### test.py
#### Overview
# Overview

The provided Python script, `test.py`, is designed to interact with a language model (Ollama) and a cache system (SemanticCache). The primary function of this script is to ask the user for input, check if a response is available in the cache, and return it if found. If not, the script will use the Ollama model to generate a response, store it in the cache, and then display both the cached and newly generated responses along with their respective processing times.

# Details

## Imports

- `time`: Used for measuring the time taken for cache checks and language model (LLM) operations.
- `ChatOllama` from `langchain_ollama`: This is a class used to interact with an Ollama language model. It takes a model name as input (`model="llama3.2"` in this case).
- `SemanticCache` from `redisvl.extensions.llmcache`: A cache system for storing and retrieving responses generated by LLMs.
- `vectorizer` (imported via a function): An object used to vectorize the input prompts into numerical representations that can be compared using cosine similarity.
- `os` and `load_dotenv`: Used to load environment variables from a `.env` file, which contains Redis URL in this case (`redis_url = os.getenv('REDIS_URL')`).

## Initialization

- The script initializes the SemanticCache object with specified parameters like `redis_url`, `distance_threshold`, and `vectorizer`. It also sets connection parameters such as socket timeout and retry mechanism to handle potential issues during Redis communication.
- If an exception occurs during initialization, it prints the error message and exits the program.

## Main Logic

1. Prompt user for input (`question = input("Enter your question:")`).
2. Ask Ollama model for a response using `ask_ollama(question)` function (defined below).
3. Measure the time taken to check the cache for this prompt and store it in `cache_time`.
4. If the cache has a matching response, retrieve it (`cached_response = llmcache.check(prompt=question)`) and print relevant details along with `cache_time`.
5. If no cached response is found:
    - Measure time taken for LLM to generate a new response (`llm_time`).
    - Print the question, generated response, and `llm_time`.
    - Store the generated response in the cache using `llmcache.store(prompt=question, response=response)` and print a success message.
6. If any exceptions occur during LLM operations (e.g., generating or storing responses), catch them and print an error message.
